# supreme selenium

This is one of two parts of a small project I worked on.
This part is the client code: it's what is executed on each node in a horizontally scalable system.
This would be a useful starting point if you wanted to simulate/pretend to be a user on a webpage.
The other part is the master/server code, you can find that billing_server_public. It deals with scaling.
I'm just making it public now, this is a copy of the old repository with secrets redacted.
